# NFT standard

The standard is an extension of the token contract in the Aptos framework to provide a richer ecosystem for Aptos NFT.
The extensions will be done in two parts, one is the collection, and the other is the token.

# Collections

The standard extension is based on [token.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move) in aptos-token.
[token.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move) defined the fields in the collection section as following.
